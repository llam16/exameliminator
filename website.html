    <section>  <h3>PURPOSE</h3><p>High School serves one key purpose. College preparation. Often in highschool, students work so hard to reach their goals of getting into college or just planning to be successful in the future. Through our experience, we have noticed that many students often choose the things they want to do only based on what will look good to colleges and not deciding from their hearts. The competitive nature of high school students today, leads to a LOT of stress, from handling sports, AP tests, SATs, tests, homework, and just doing anything which could potentially help increase their chances of getting into college.
</p><p></p><p>As students in the bay area, all of us began to talk about our experiences with standardized tests, homework, and classes, and soon came to a realization that a lot of high schools have become extremely stressful within the past years. We decided that we should make a game that expresses the culture of competitive high schools, raising awareness to the unhealthy amount of stress that students experience.
</p><p></p><p>Our game is designed as a coping mechanism for students overwhelmed with the all the things that may be causing stress in their lives.</p></section>
